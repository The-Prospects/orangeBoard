A picture is worth a thousand words. When you canâ€™t get your ideas across with just your words sometimes you need to draw it out. With OrangeBoard, you can start a collaborative whiteboard session with your team, colleagues, and educators to visualize ideas remotely. OrangeBoard is also integrated with the Slack API so you can start a session in a workspace channel with a quick and easy / slash command.
